title: Hacking New Year!
---

It's been a rough one eh? 2022 was full of ups and downs, and I started this blog. I made it because I really wanted to share all the hacking good stuff, but most of all, make myself learn more.

And yeah, that didn't go at all well. I had a lot of plans of things to write here, but then university hit me with a bunch of things, and then I got a new job! I'm not at all being ungrateful for that, but this just wore me off and I got less and less interested in keeping it going for some time. With all those things consuming my energy, combined with my seasonal "I don't want to do a damn thing" mentality, my spare time was spent on watching movies, anime, playing videogame and seeing friends.

Having now a refreshed mind I feel the need starting to grow again, that good feeling of wanting to know more and take on new challenges. The blog is not dead, and hopefully will continue as my need to work hard on what I love starts again.

May this year be full of opportunities, happiness, and, most of all, lots and lots of hackings!
