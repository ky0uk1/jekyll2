I'm Kyouki and I like to break things. That's it.

Jokes aside, I plan on making posts here and document my journey through the security path. I plan on doing writeups on: 

*   Tryhackme
*   Hackthebox
*   Overthewire
*   PicoCtf

And much more.

Besides the writeups I plan on making posts about hacking games, malware analysis and other topics that i stumble upon and learn about.
